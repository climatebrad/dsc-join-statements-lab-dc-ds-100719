    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Write SQL queries that make use of various types of joins\n",
    "* Compare and contrast the various types of joins\n",
    "* Discuss how primary and foreign keys are used in SQL\n",
    "* Decide and perform whichever type of join is best for retrieving desired data"
